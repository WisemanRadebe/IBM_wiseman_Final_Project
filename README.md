ðŸš€ IBM Data Science Capstone Project: Predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Success
This project is the final capstone for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate offered on Coursera. The goal is to predict the likelihood of a successful landing of the first stage of SpaceXâ€™s Falcon 9 rocket using historical data and machine learning techniques.

ðŸ“Š Objective
SpaceX has developed reusable rockets to reduce the cost of space travel. The success of the first-stage booster landing is crucial to this mission. This project aims to:

Analyze past launch data from SpaceX.

Build a classification model to predict landing success.

Provide visual insights and deploy a predictive tool.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebooks

IBM Watson Studio

SQL and Dash (for dashboard creation)

Key Features
Data Collection & Cleaning: Scraped SpaceX launch data from Wikipedia and SpaceX API, and cleaned it for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized trends in launch outcomes, launch sites, and payload impacts.

Modeling: Trained classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree) to predict landing outcomes.

Dashboard: Developed an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash to visualize launch insights and predictions.

ðŸ§  Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using metrics like:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

Confusion Matrix

The best-performing model was chosen based on cross-validation scores.

 Lessons Learned
This project demonstrates the complete data science pipeline from data acquisition to deploying a machine learning solution. Key skills applied include:

Web scraping and data wrangling

Exploratory data analysis

Machine learning model development

Building interactive dashboards
